      <h3>Maker's Notebook #4</h3>
      <p>For the final project in my Hacking, Tinkering, and Making class, I tackled the Maker's Challenge wherein the goal is to combine three skills learned over the course of the past few months in order to make something interesting. I wanted to combine my experience with 3D printing together with my innate knack for cobbling parts together and the automation control afforded by the Hummingbird arduino board we've been learning to use. I was inspired by the myriad toys and curiosities found in the online store, <a href="https://www.thinkgeek.com/product/ef0b/">Think Geek</a>; specifically (as linked) a product called a Useless Box.</p>
      <p>The Useless Box is pretty aptly named; it's a simple box with a switch on top, and when a user flips the switch, a mechanical arm pops out of the box to turn the switch back off again, before retreating back into it's rectangular lair. It's a very simple concept, and one well suited to the Maker's Challenge (not to mention I'd love to have one for less than $30)!</p>
			<p>When I was first getting started on this, I knew from a previous prototype I had done during the regular instruction time in class that I needed parts that were sturdier than cardboard and twist ties to hold this thing together and make it function, so I fired up <a href="https://tinkercad.com">TinkerCad</a> and started modeling a box of my own. I measured the dimensions of the servo and arduino board and made placeholders in the modeling space, then modeled a box around them to mark the space I had to work with. I then modeled a pendulum piece that would act as the switch, along with a helical part that I could attach to the servo to act as the robotic arm.</p>
			<p>Having modeled these, I took to the 3D printer to realize them. In addition, I found on the Hummingbird website some printable parts which included a servo mount that would add a great deal of much needed stability to the overall design. The box itself that I had modeled was estimated to take 28 hours of straight print time, so I was forced to forgo an exact print to specifications in favor of something prefabricated (which is fancy-speak for "I found a cardboard box").</p>
			<p>I mounted these parts in their proper places within the box using a comination of nuts and bolts, nails, pins, and hot glue. The arm is activated when the pendulum-switch is flipped such that it blocks the path of light from an LED to a light sensor on the arduino board; the arm moves the switch back to its home position. It's a little bit buggy because the nail that's used to hold the pendulum on the box as a free hinge isn't super stable (on account of it being in cardboard), as well as the pendulum not easily holding fast to the edge of the box where it blocks the light (on account of this really only working at all because the hot glue was still tacky enough to stick to it). </p>
			<p>All in all, I'd call the project a success, given the fact that I did manage to get it to behave properly at the end of my in-class presentation! In the future, I'd probably set about improving it by finding a better way to hold the pendulum in the 'on' position such that the limited torque of the servo can still knock it back into 'off' position, as well as just generally improving the stability of the pendulum arc.</p>

      <p>The Internet of Things, or IoT for short, captures the idea that the devices we use - refrigerators, cars, even our clothing - can be connected to the internet so that they can send and receive data.  First, find some articles that describe current IoT applications.  Use these to imagine how something you use frequently could be transformed into an IoT device.</p>
      <p>Article: <a href="https://iot-analytics.com/10-internet-of-things-applications/">The 10 most popular Internet of Things applications right now</a></p>
      <img src="https://iot-analytics.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IoT-application-ranking-v3.png" alt="bar graph from the article" style="width:530px;height:300px;">
			<p>A bar graph from the article visually displaying the different applications fo IoT ordered by how much talk there is about it on the internet, using google searches and twitter data</p>
      <p>Response: Given the popularity of connected home products on the internet forum, I decided to consider ideas under this sub-umbrella. The first thing that comes to mind when thinking of things I use frequently at home is my desktop computer, which is hardly a candidate for internet of things-ification at first look. It's a computer; half the stuff I do on it requires the internet. However, when you look at it a little more closely, there are some things that it doesn't do that the internet could help with if applied properly. For example, my computer spends a lot of time on but not doing anything, because I leave it on when I leave to go to school so I can remote into it and use features that my chromebook lacks. It would be really nice if I could somehow turn it off, and more importantly, on again, from a distance so I can save energy! There are no new ideas though, so I'm pretty sure this issue has been solved.</p>
			<p>Beyond sitting at my computer writing code and playing games, the number one waking activity that I do at home is cook and eat. Unfortunately, I frequently have a hard time with eating at a regular time, and as a result I sometimes forget to eat until it's practically midnight and I want to sleep. SO! If I could preheat my oven on my short drive home, that would give me impetus enough to make dinner as soon as I get home and keep me healthy and fed! It would also be great if there were a device in my fridge and pantry to let me know what ingredients I have, and what I might need to pick up from the store on my way home to make my meal more interesting than just pasta and chicken again for 50th time.</p>
			<p>In the previous paragraph, I specifically mentioned 'waking activities' because out of what time during the day that I do spend at home, the truly largest chunk of it is spent sleeping. A proper future home would be able to track my sleeping habits and internal body temperature, which would interface with the a/c or heating and make it so I don't wake up in the middle of the night freezing/sweating to death. Or both, that's the worst. Please internet. Help me sleep. </p>

      <h3>Maker's Notebook #1</h3>
      <p>Prompt: It is the year 4022; all of the ancient country of Usa has been buried under many feet of detritus from a catastrophe that occurred back in 2016. You are an amateur archeologist who stumbles upon a burial chamber.  In it you find a number of objects.  Select one and describe it.  Knowing nothing about the ancient civilization of Usa, how do you think this object was used?</p>
      <p>Object: Stylized stereo speakers with 3.5mm input</p>
      <p>Note, there are two of these connected together</p>
      <img src="speakerFront.jpg" alt="front view" style="width:530px;height:300px;">
      <img src="speakerFrontTop.jpg" alt="oblique view" style="width:530px;height:300px;">
      <img src="speakerLeft.jpg" alt="left view" style="width:530px;height:300px;">
      <img src="speakerRight.jpg" alt="right view" style="width:530px;height:300px;">
      <p>Response: Within the burial chamber, amongst a variety of other curiosities, was this pair of red and silver stylized flowers. They were connected together via a long cable ending in a metallic point about 3.5 mm in diameter. I suspect that the ancients may have used this device as a censer for diffusal of ceremonial incense; the pointed 'stem' of each 'flower' can be removed to reveal a small aperture through which I believe aromatic flowers and leaves could be inserted and lit, whereupon after sealing the censer aperture once more, the smoke would diffuse out of the metal mesh 'petals' as the censer is swung back and forth.</p>
