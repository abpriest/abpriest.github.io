      <p>The Internet of Things, or IoT for short, captures the idea that the devices we use - refrigerators, cars, even our clothing - can be connected to the internet so that they can send and receive data.  First, find some articles that describe current IoT applications.  Use these to imagine how something you use frequently could be transformed into an IoT device.</p>
      <p>Article: <a href="https://iot-analytics.com/10-internet-of-things-applications/">The 10 most popular Internet of Things applications right now</a></p>
      <img src="https://iot-analytics.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IoT-application-ranking-v3.png" alt="bar graph from the article" style="width:530px;height:300px;">

      <p>Response: Given the popularity of connected home products on the internet forum, I decided to consider ideas under this sub-umbrella. The first thing that comes to mind when thinking of things I use frequently at home is my desktop computer, which is hardly a candidate for internet of things-ification at first look. It's a computer; half the stuff I do on it requires the internet. However, when you look at it a little more closely, there are some things that it doesn't do that the internet could help with if applied properly. For example, my computer spends a lot of time on but not doing anything, because I leave it on when I leave to go to school so I can remote into it and use features that my chromebook lacks. It would be really nice if I could somehow turn it off, and more importantly, on again, from a distance so I can save energy! There are no new ideas though, so I'm pretty sure this issue has been solved.</p>
			<p>Beyond sitting at my computer writing code and playing games, the number one waking activity that I do at home is cook and eat. Unfortunately, I frequently have a hard time with eating at a regular time, and as a result I sometimes forget to eat until it's practically midnight and I want to sleep. SO! If I could preheat my oven on my short drive home, that would give me impetus enough to make dinner as soon as I get home and keep me healthy and fed! It would also be great if there were a device in my fridge and pantry to let me know what ingredients I have, and what I might need to pick up from the store on my way home to make my meal more interesting than just pasta and chicken again for 50th time.</p>
			<p>In the previous paragraph, I specifically mentioned 'waking activities' because out of what time during the day that I do spend at home, the truly largest chunk of it is spent sleeping. A proper future home would be able to track my sleeping habits and internal body temperature, which would interface with the a/c or heating and make it so I don't wake up in the middle of the night freezing/sweating to death. Or both, that's the worst. Please internet. Help me sleep. </p>

      <p>Response: 3D bioprinting works by using the printer to create a scaffold structure to support cell growth, and then pipetting cells onto the scaffold to begin the process of organ formation.</p>

      <h3>Maker's Notebook #1</h3>
      <p>Prompt: It is the year 4022; all of the ancient country of Usa has been buried under many feet of detritus from a catastrophe that occurred back in 2016. You are an amateur archeologist who stumbles upon a burial chamber.  In it you find a number of objects.  Select one and describe it.  Knowing nothing about the ancient civilization of Usa, how do you think this object was used?</p>
      <p>Object: Stylized stereo speakers with 3.5mm input</p>
      <p>Note, there are two of these connected together</p>
      <img src="speakerFront.jpg" alt="front view" style="width:530px;height:300px;">
      <img src="speakerFrontTop.jpg" alt="oblique view" style="width:530px;height:300px;">
      <img src="speakerLeft.jpg" alt="left view" style="width:530px;height:300px;">
      <img src="speakerRight.jpg" alt="right view" style="width:530px;height:300px;">
      <p>Response: Within the burial chamber, amongst a variety of other curiosities, was this pair of red and silver stylized flowers. They were connected together via a long cable ending in a metallic point about 3.5 mm in diameter. I suspect that the ancients may have used this device as a censer for diffusal of ceremonial incense; the pointed 'stem' of each 'flower' can be removed to reveal a small aperture through which I believe aromatic flowers and leaves could be inserted and lit, whereupon after sealing the censer aperture once more, the smoke would diffuse out of the metal mesh 'petals' as the censer is swung back and forth.</p>
